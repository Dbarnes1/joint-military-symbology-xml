# Building JMSML CSV Files #

To update one or more of the CSV files needed to produce Esri's style files or database schema, run the appropriate batch file or files located under any of the sub-folders under the [samples](https://github.com/Esri/joint-military-symbology-xml/tree/dev/samples) folder, by double clicking on them in Windows Explorer.

To rebuild all of the JMSML sample CSV files, run the [RunAll.bat](https://github.com/Esri/joint-military-symbology-xml/blob/dev/RunAll.bat) file by simply double clicking on it inside Windows Explorer.

These batch files use the JMSML console application, whose executable and supporting dlls can be found under this bin folder.
